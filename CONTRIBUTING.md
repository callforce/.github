## 🏗 Contribution Guide 

### 🌳 Branches

At times, we rely on a branch's name to automatically take action on a pull request, so please adhere to the following format for branch names:

`<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<CHANGE_TYPE>/<ASSOCIATED_GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER>`

* `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Include your GitHub username in branch name
* `CHANGE_TYPE`: Include the type of change the branch will include; options are `feature`, `fix`, or `documentation`
* `ASSOCIATED_GITHUB_ISSUE_NUMBER`: If applicable, include GitHub issue number associated with the changes

Here are some examples for branch names:

* `mishamilovidov/feature/132`
* `connerludlow/fix/32`
* `mishamilovidov/documentation`
